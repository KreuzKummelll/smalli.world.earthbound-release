The numbers are the people.\nThey tell the time with the sun until the sun sets.\nShe will follow the sun on its journey through the window of our sky.\nUnlike any desire to fear her existence she embraces it.\nShe is taking a shower now and feeling her body and skin.\nBlood swirls through her mind at her own touch. She has no romantic desire.\nOnly the voice of someone she had cared for for more than any other.\nFor that is what she desires.\nAnd he is happy to provide her, her Amazonka.",

    "text" : "I would go so far to say it is a Worldly Karmic issue that needs to either be incorporated into a balanced body or needs to ejected into the atmosphere with all its waste. Friedrich Nietzsche prophesied that [humanity] would give its debts no longer to God but to credit. (Debt and credit are both expressed in German with the word Schuld or Schulden.) As money becomes spread out like margarine, the fiat butter, our bodies (i.e. communities) become sick with huge franchise and control over property. Property and boundaries of sundry types. To properly govern a world of all equitability, citizens shall live in proximity to one another.\n\tThere is much to say about the benefits of living in proximity to food resources (i.e. buying local, urban farming), to energy resources (i.e. geothermal, wind). Resources provide ways for communities to subsist on the land. Jobs [I almost want to put the word in quotation marks] have been the mainstay of the argument since the dawning of the age of Cyclical Metal (industrial age). However a new child of this World has been born and its numbers and power are spreading their wings.\n\tLandmark events render levels of generational gaps among  parents and children. The landmark event of my generation and its peers has been the de-feathering of souls across nations. Terrors have swept before the eyes of a visually afflicted nation running from their own reflection held in their hand and whatever delusions arise therefrom. September Eleventh showed a leader nation that although there are those out there that lash out against US American world policing and aggressive policy, it is that very entity that calls itself the USA that polices itself to a serious detriment. \n\tThe spiraling spirits of a grand United States of America is a microcosm for the future of the Humans on this Planet. The sacredness surrounding the United States of America and all the countries in America, including South American entities like Brazil and Nicaragua, needs to be stabilized in the exactly opposite direction it is progressing now. \n\tIndeed it is the word ‘progress’ that needs to be shifted into a much more dynamic model of swelling and easing, rather than a shot arrow aimed at the Sun. Not only ‘progress’, but other words of profound meaning that are lost to American, and all English speaking Humans. \n\tLanguage defines reality and many Americans can only define their reality in English. Many people are prepared to live the rest of their life through and through on the land where they were brought up and told to remain. Why should a city bring them to temptation to leave where they love? Rural townships are dwindling and our storehouse of healthy rural hubs, distribution centers of creativity and light, will replenish but hardly soon enough. \n\tRemodeling a governing principle requires the commission approval of the Great Body. That is our population of the World, of which there is One God and it is not Man. Man’s role is to increase the light of Miracles on the Planet to celebrate. So let us do our Duty and uphold our end of the Deal. Let the chambers of God’s Gold be brought out into the People in divine precession and silence after weeks of feast and community to All. Let repay the Fickle the Forgiving for their share of energy stored in their vaults, their earned interest on the energy of labor. Who collects interest on that? \n\tConstant reiteration that if there were anything bad about strangling a Human with the ropes of unscrupulous capitalism to let it be known has bankrupted America’s Moral Endeavor because as our leaders use this Grammar (Old French gramaire) or rhetoric while actually committing what they say not to do. All countries do this in some way, however there are degrees distinguishing countries from countries. \n\tIn the United States of America, ‘Freedom’ is used as an idol to torment the souls of a bored country into serving its Ultimate End, discrediting itself along the way. George Bush Jr. once said that ‘the Iraqis hate us for our freedoms’. What then do we hate them for? For their Faith? For their Faith in a Holy Spirit much like the Holy Spirit of a land that harbors all types of birds. \n\tA complete unawareness of the Spiritual container that the United States of America is dirties up the waters that are desperately trying to clear themselves up. Money stands in the way of people spreading their wings. Their call cannot be answered because their debts go to creditors for their faults from temptation into buying. Ensnarled are the flocks in their own mess that is the elephant in the room. \n\tFrankenstein’s Monster found consciousness to be full of pain, but only after he was denied the right to live exactly as one who lives in love. Our problem today is that we mix up luxury for love. Whereas the luxurious markets comfort, only a torn blanket, a fire, and a clear starry night actually provides comfort in the proximity of our Mother. Frankenstein’s Monster – who, by the way, deserves a name [I’ll call him Dan] — hunts down Dr Frankenstein to administer a justice upon him for creating him and not nursing him. Dan desires a maternal influence. The cutting and creating done with the sword has shaped its Monster (and We are it!) and it needs maternal nursing.\n\tAll countries around the World need nursing and support, the smallest most especially. Haille Salassie told the UN and other Greater African Leaders have told to UN and the USA that it would fight its Male dominated emasculation efforts with more male dominated emasculation in the form of penetrating rocket missiles and ice skating tanks, and Russia tired to come first but  (Yes, of course, I and others like me do not understand the complexity of the whole thing, and…) The thing is, governing has lost its tracks because as this stage of the game, there are no tracks. We are indeed lost. It has not gone wrong so to say, and it has not given up. But to give it up would mean the reestablishment of everything.  \n\tOut of carbon flour there shall be built the largest permanent body of the Single Worldly Forum. All citizens participate. They must serve for the governing of the World. All together Humans of paths distant and near come together in a forum designed to bring Humans close to one another to share stories and live as brothers and sisters and parents and grandparents in the World Unanimous. \n\tThe World Unanimous is not a company or governmental body. It is a word to describe an inexplicable process of holistic world governing agreeable to all parts of the body. This agreeableness is achieved by integrating all bodies into a closer sphere of communication. Virtual reality will bring people of all countries to the tables to restructure Personhood on this Planet. Because without the dismemberment of past barriers and limitations there will be no success of future generations. However our curtain call means we must be prepared to go in a direction never gone before since the creation of credit. To redirect our guilt of life not to the institutions and their golden idols but to the One Initiator, the One Governor. \n\tStart by ease. \n\t\nIn strength for i am i and I. — Small i\n\nTo do a deed humbly gains prestige, using that prestige for implication is power. Power can be used to do what ever you want. It is only that we don’t want. We let God want, for He is our Shepard. He leads us to green grass to eat. We cannot continue to eat ourselves, eat the Flesh of other animals that we no longer sacrifice to God but to the Man of Evolution and even to the minuscule hand of one man torn in pieces by Unknowing. Man works for Evolution. God has imagined life and we now live it. Let us do work for the Almighty again. This time, in the Northwest, and no money shall oppress the Emergence. \n\n\nElon Musk has come out and said that life may very well be a simulation or part of a game. Hollywood and the great unnamed prophets behind films have pointed fingers to something similar in films like The Matrix, and Authors have written books like Endor’s Game.

This creates tension so high with those who what it, tension concerning basic truths. Where are we here today? What have we to offer the Omnipotent? I am done cashing checks and banks are even done banking, employers no longer interested in employing. We all want to work together to see a coming unlike all before.

Let us build one shining Crystal City as a beacon of having come back to God and that the Lost Tribes of Israel have again found their Living God and live eternally at the foot of God’s throne. Mount Shasta, She-Mountain of Elemental Omnipotent Light, and surrounding mountains and valleys are exactly opportune areas for life and surviving.

For only his name’s sake does the Lord our God remember his promise.

What is the point of all this? It is the reasoning behind fulfilling a longstanding desire to help fulfill God’s Promise to the race of Isaac (Anglo-Saxons) and to the Grace of God that exists in all other hearts of the Millions lost from the natural rhythm of our Living God. So come all. Take part in the largest event in history where we usher back the mortal Kings and Queens of our God. And let us build and heal and praise and clean. We would design our Stronghold after this model: YOD-HÉ-VAU-HÉ. Where In the Beginning there was the Word and that Word was God. YOD and GOD are changed by only one letter, which etymologically are the same, as we can see in English ‘day’ and German ‘tag’ or English ‘Yester’ and German ‘gestern’. YOD is first. It is the active principle. It is intention. HÉ is next; it is the passive principle, that which casts a shadow. VAU is a triangle of truth between the two and it is the neutral principle. The second HÉ is the manifestation or the phenomenon. That is the way of God. The way of Science is that of Evolution and that of Quantity and the Idol of Trial and Error. Because the Scientific formula is the opposite of that of Faith. HÉ-VAU-HÉ-YOD prioritizes the passive principle of material as the life-giving principle, follows with the human mind (intellect), thirdly comes the combination in, here he is, Evolution; and finally comes together in the scientific method. This has happened because of the mirroring of God’s name YHVH. For his name’s sake, God shall return to uphold his Promise. \n\tThe location is important because from the root of Sacred Shasta brings forth a spring that is a river that flows into the breadbasket that is central California Valley, producer of a world of food. The Mountain sheds millions of gallons of water a day ** south and east and north.  Far north of Shasta, in the Pacific Northwest are remnants of the greatest flood in history in the fertile grounds of the Oregon Coast south of Portland. Near Portland is also Mt Hood, along the base of which flows the Columbia River, a huge conveyer of life force with roots reaching out into the Great Plains of the United States.  \n\tThe 85 cubic miles that make up the massive base of Mount Shasta, a composite volcano towering over a series of folded mountains to the south and over California’s only National Grassland, going onto Klamath Falls, Oregon. The real Wild West. The Northwest wilderness starts at the gate that Shasta is. Traveling north along Interstate 5 a group of friends on a road trip north can see the Mountain enlightening the horizon well above and behind other mountains 100 miles away. This Shining Mountain of Glory is already a beacon. \n\tFrom cities packed full of young adults and old adults , mature adults and immature adults, children of all ages and insurmountable hope live in boredom and without Fathers. Yes, i and I are talking about America. Children all too soon grown up to take care of Destitude brought to look desperately for alternatives. Until now it has been money ruling. Those looking to fulfill dreams of old begin a big business that benefits those souls who trade energy for money. Together we create money. But just as an internet meme has illustrated so well many profess hard work while being served. That must have something to do with our arrogance as White Man.  Everyone on the Planet works hard. Everyone does not get the benefit, however, and thank God for that. Actually, yes, thank God for putting us in hiding, up in a high place. So people come to Mount Shasta to retreat from a way they have decided against, to proceed on a route in root with humanity. They used to go to San Francisco, but now the generation’s greatest minds in world craft and spiritual sciences march on to the Northwest. \n\tAs times get tough globally and great countries seem to crumble visibly, a truth known for a long time comes to pass; that a gigantic leap in a up-wealth of love for our Living God in each of us will propel us into becoming Homo spiritus. In order to lead by example and create a beacon city to the rest of the \n\nWe are dropping a stone of peace and calm into \n\nBabylon exists in our minds as a vale to crossing over.\n\n\nWe must truly defeat our enemies by integrating them. I grew up in a democrat house and only now has it gotten so bad that I say that I feel more conservative now just because I have learned some lessons concerning loyalty. Liberals and Conservatives must integrate, because defeating the other only looks like what is going on now, which has instigated this competition. \n\nThere is no time to waste before beginning the moral transition that we call the spiritual transition. Morality and upholding strict commands on opening our hearts is the lesson. The Miracle that is the City of Shasta, encompassing the entire mountain. The City will be gentle on the land. We will break stone with ways other than with metal, rather with the palms of our hand. Our City is founded on people and slow, individually allocated cohesion on a transitionary level. This will bring the return to the Center that the Lost Children of Isaac and the entire World needs. \n\tThis Grand Plan of the Almighty One of Creation has come to me out of Divine Word and heritage. It comes to All the World as Divine Word. This is because whether by Race (seed) or Grace (word), the entire World has been opened to the Right to be Kings and Queens of Man serving God Most High in this Place of Goodly Refuge. \n\tWe must do this now because both science and religion point to the end of days. Religion points to it from clues in the Old Testament. In each series of catastraphies in the old Testament, some things had to be done to preserve enough Humanity to survive the flood (air and fire). Proposed is a plan to begin construction of Shasta (what, in his lore, Tolkien called Minas Tirith at the end of the Third Age after the fall of Osgiliarth). That is the thing, we have taken a fall. \nNot only that but the Deutsche Archäologe Institut ** under Klaus Schmidt found (Turkish name) Göbekli Tepe. \n\nThat is the thing, we have taken a fall. So let us get up like a snake hissing through burrows on the ground is forced by a moral endeavor within his gut to wind itself up, for no reason whatsoever, a brass pole stood in the ground. Upon the climb, facing many doubts and desires in sensations and dreams, voices lure him back down to the ground, for he is only a snake. He belongs on the ground. He does not like heights, he feels sick. But he feels good somewhere, so he concentrates on that with even his toes and ears. Our snake has somehow made it only pushes away from the head of the staff. And before he expects it and has a chance to look around, the staff is heaved out of the spot it was in. The snake is on a forever journey on the rod. \n\tIn the presence of Divinity at this moment we must get ourselves onto our Living God’s rod. We may not have another chance. And the consequences of heaving ourselves up onto the pole would be a moral endeavor to harmonize life on Earth. \n\t\n\tHow to do it: \n\n\tStart small. We get started in the cities already established around the vast foot of Mount Shasta. We shall introduce ourselves there. I bring everyone who is interested to initiate into wor(l)d-space the Beautiful Sight of our Living Almighty God; that we, as mortal humans, establish a Moral Claim to fulfill ourside of the deal (specifically directed at Anglo-Saxon Americans) (meaning that we must harbor Faith and operate in concordance (divinity) instead of opposition (electricity). Going back to the stars, where light pollution, sound pollution, waste pollution are taken into account as blockading our return to those stars, we cut these pollutions out — by building with waste as like the Earth Ships in New Mexico. That is stage one. Earthships in the ground, were well water is plentiful even for fountains (of whose water we will sustain ourselves). \n\tTo be a beacon for the World and an Arc, every bit taken from the land must be used in that land alone. Here, at the foot of Sacred Mount Shasta, there are the Marble Mountains. Quartz veins run throughout the entire area (going to middle school quartz lies around in the gravel, in love). \n\t[Here I must interject and mention that if an attempt is begun to speed anything up to impatience under the idol of Progress, it will be blocked by the Hand of God and it would be like a spitting on his Gracious Hand. All development will be lead by local spiritual leaders. It is your job to be patient and discover the Light of the Lord in the Area.]  \n\t\n\tGetting more to the Light of the Beacon: \n\tThe University. It is actually a Mystery School. But it builds itself, in two ways. First, it builds itself from its first students onward. From then on out it becomes the community itself, all part of a flowering system of anatomy. As the physical buildings are constructed to reside in the land, Students of agriculture, who earnestly need practice for what they learned at UC Davis for instance, come to pioneer innovative and miraculous growing techniques to feel the blooming Humanity already living on the sea of glass emanating from the Mountain. \n\tThe region is beyond size comparison. Food can be grown in all cubic miles of the Northwest (up and down, left and right). The truth of it is, these mountains are our natural skyscrapers. Their folded slopes extend the length of the land beyond measure. And when we learn to grow food with the help of the trees that are there, we maximize natural space. We are on a moral endeavor to be at one (atone) with a Natural religion with our Living God. We want to live a compete return to our Creator, our Living God. He appears as we appear to Him. We approach the Origin of all religion, in One. Rasta brethren and sisters and roots reggae musicians are personally invited to walk through the streets as churches and beacons of light and joy. \n\tNatural religion, where we delve into feeling nature and appreciating it as non-fallen Nature, we shall embrace the entire Holy Tree that is Cannabis. It will indeed heal Generations. We shall plant forests of it, but one large Tree of Life shall we receive after working the land with our hands in alignment with Nature. It will grow collectively as we grow collectively; blessed by the divine presence of Living God, Eternal Weaver, who has intention about how he would like the piece to turn out, as we do when we weave. \n\tThe Human labor will be from the local citizens to begin with. Everything for them will be payed for by you. At first we look at which citizens have which skills. There are many skilled crafts people, millers, foresters, builders, landscape designers, all looking for work. You shall not employ them, you shall give them the money as their way to sustain their work that they love. \n\tIdeally we walk, as no other being on the planet is as good for walking as Human Beings; however, in the early stages, transportation must be established between cities around the mountain. Here we call upon students across the United States and the World to create all without patents. A Crystal City shall exist in all sharing of ideas and not boarders of currency but to continue self-sustainment (see China’s Hardware City). That city however is much unlike Shasta, for it has been built on the foundations of money. We shall build Shasta on the Foundations of our Living God, Ever Present.",

    "text" : "I would go so far to say it is a Worldly Karmic issue that needs to either be incorporated into a balanced body or needs to ejected into the atmosphere with all its waste. Friedrich Nietzsche prophesied that [humanity] would give its debts no longer to God but to credit. (Debt and credit are both expressed in German with the word Schuld or Schulden.) As money becomes spread out like margarine, the fiat butter, our bodies (i.e. communities) become sick with huge franchise and control over property. Property and boundaries of sundry types. To properly govern a world of all equitability, citizens shall live in proximity to one another.\n\tThere is much to say about the benefits of living in proximity to food resources (i.e. buying local, urban farming), to energy resources (i.e. geothermal, wind). Resources provide ways for communities to subsist on the land. Jobs [I almost want to put the word in quotation marks] have been the mainstay of the argument since the dawning of the age of Cyclical Metal (industrial age). However a new child of this World has been born and its numbers and power are spreading their wings.\n\tLandmark events render levels of generational gaps among  parents and children. The landmark event of my generation and its peers has been the de-feathering of souls across nations. Terrors have swept before the eyes of a visually afflicted nation running from their own reflection held in their hand and whatever delusions arise therefrom. September Eleventh showed a leader nation that although there are those out there that lash out against US American world policing and aggressive policy, it is that very entity that calls itself the USA that polices itself to a serious detriment. \n\tThe spiraling spirits of a grand United States of America is a microcosm for the future of the Humans on this Planet. The sacredness surrounding the United States of America and all the countries in America, including South American entities like Brazil and Nicaragua, needs to be stabilized in the exactly opposite direction it is progressing now. \n\tIndeed it is the word ‘progress’ that needs to be shifted into a much more dynamic model of swelling and easing, rather than a shot arrow aimed at the Sun. Not only ‘progress’, but other words of profound meaning that are lost to American, and all English speaking Humans. \n\tLanguage defines reality and many Americans can only define their reality in English. Many people are prepared to live the rest of their life through and through on the land where they were brought up and told to remain. Why should a city bring them to temptation to leave where they love? Rural townships are dwindling and our storehouse of healthy rural hubs, distribution centers of creativity and light, will replenish but hardly soon enough. \n\tRemodeling a governing principle requires the commission approval of the Great Body. That is our population of the World, of which there is One God and it is not Man. Man’s role is to increase the light of Miracles on the Planet to celebrate. So let us do our Duty and uphold our end of the Deal. Let the chambers of God’s Gold be brought out into the People in divine precession and silence after weeks of feast and community to All. Let repay the Fickle the Forgiving for their share of energy stored in their vaults, their earned interest on the energy of labor. Who collects interest on that? \n\tConstant reiteration that if there were anything bad about strangling a Human with the ropes of unscrupulous capitalism to let it be known has bankrupted America’s Moral Endeavor because as our leaders use this Grammar (Old French gramaire) or rhetoric while actually committing what they say not to do. All countries do this in some way, however there are degrees distinguishing countries from countries. \n\tIn the United States of America, ‘Freedom’ is used as an idol to torment the souls of a bored country into serving its Ultimate End, discrediting itself along the way. George Bush Jr. once said that ‘the Iraqis hate us for our freedoms’. What then do we hate them for? For their Faith? For their Faith in a Holy Spirit much like the Holy Spirit of a land that harbors all types of birds. \n\tA complete unawareness of the Spiritual container that the United States of America is dirties up the waters that are desperately trying to clear themselves up. Money stands in the way of people spreading their wings. Their call cannot be answered because their debts go to creditors for their faults from temptation into buying. Ensnarled are the flocks in their own mess that is the elephant in the room. \n\tFrankenstein’s Monster found consciousness to be full of pain, but only after he was denied the right to live exactly as one who lives in love. Our problem today is that we mix up luxury for love. Whereas the luxurious markets comfort, only a torn blanket, a fire, and a clear starry night actually provides comfort in the proximity of our Mother. Frankenstein’s Monster – who, by the way, deserves a name [I’ll call him Dan] — hunts down Dr Frankenstein to administer a justice upon him for creating him and not nursing him. Dan desires a maternal influence. The cutting and creating done with the sword has shaped its Monster (and We are it!) and it needs maternal nursing.\n\tAll countries around the World need nursing and support, the smallest most especially. Haille Salassie told the UN and other Greater African Leaders have told to UN and the USA that it would fight its Male dominated emasculation efforts with more male dominated emasculation in the form of penetrating rocket missiles and ice skating tanks, and Russia tired to come first but  (Yes, of course, I and others like me do not understand the complexity of the whole thing, and…) The thing is, governing has lost its tracks because as this stage of the game, there are no tracks. We are indeed lost. It has not gone wrong so to say, and it has not given up. But to give it up would mean the reestablishment of everything.  \n\tOut of carbon flour there shall be built the largest permanent body of the Single Worldly Forum. All citizens participate. They must serve for the governing of the World. All together Humans of paths distant and near come together in a forum designed to bring Humans close to one another to share stories and live as brothers and sisters and parents and grandparents in the World Unanimous. \n\tThe World Unanimous is not a company or governmental body. It is a word to describe an inexplicable process of holistic world governing agreeable to all parts of the body. This agreeableness is achieved by integrating all bodies into a closer sphere of communication. Virtual reality will bring people of all countries to the tables to restructure Personhood on this Planet. Because without the dismemberment of past barriers and limitations there will be no success of future generations. However our curtain call means we must be prepared to go in a direction never gone before since the creation of credit. To redirect our guilt of life not to the institutions and their golden idols but to the One Initiator, the One Governor. \n\tStart by ease. \n\t\nIn strength for i am i and I. — Small i\n\nTo do a deed humbly gains prestige, using that prestige for implication is power. Power can be used to do what ever you want. It is only that we don’t want. We let God want, for He is our Shepard. He leads us to green grass to eat. We cannot continue to eat ourselves, eat the Flesh of other animals that we no longer sacrifice to God but to the Man of Evolution and even to the minuscule hand of one man torn in pieces by Unknowing. Man works for Evolution. God has imagined life and we now live it. Let us do work for the Almighty again. This time, in the Northwest, and no money shall oppress the Emergence. \n\n\nElon Musk has come out and said that life may very well be a simulation or part of a game. Hollywood and the great unnamed prophets behind films have pointed fingers to something similar in films like The Matrix, and Authors have written books like Endor’s Game.

Traveling north along Interstate 5 a group of friends on a road trip north can see the Mountain enlightening the horizon well above and behind other mountains 100 miles away. This Shining Mountain of Glory is already a beacon. \n\tFrom cities packed full of young adults and old adults , mature adults and immature adults, children of all ages and insurmountable hope live in boredom and without Fathers. Yes, i and I are talking about America. Children all too soon grown up to take care of Destitude brought to look desperately for alternatives. Until now it has been money ruling. Those looking to fulfill dreams of old begin a big business that benefits those souls who trade energy for money. Together we create money. But just as an internet meme has illustrated so well many profess hard work while being served. That must have something to do with our arrogance as White Man.  Everyone on the Planet works hard. Everyone does not get the benefit, however, and thank God for that. Actually, yes, thank God for putting us in hiding, up in a high place. So people come to Mount Shasta to retreat from a way they have decided against, to proceed on a route in root with humanity. They used to go to San Francisco, but now the generation’s greatest minds in world craft and spiritual sciences march on to the Northwest. \n\tAs times get tough globally and great countries seem to crumble visibly, a truth known for a long time comes to pass; that a gigantic leap in a up-wealth of love for our Living God in each of us will propel us into becoming Homo spiritus. In order to lead by example and create a beacon city to the rest of the \n\nWe are dropping a stone of peace and calm into \n\nBabylon exists in our minds as a vale to crossing over.\n\n\nWe must truly defeat our enemies by integrating them. I grew up in a democrat house and only now has it gotten so bad that I say that I feel more conservative now just because I have learned some lessons concerning loyalty. Liberals and Conservatives must integrate, because defeating the other only looks like what is going on now, which has instigated this competition. \n\nThere is no time to waste before beginning the moral transition that we call the spiritual transition. Morality and upholding strict commands on opening our hearts is the lesson. The Miracle that is the City of Shasta, encompassing the entire mountain. The City will be gentle on the land. We will break stone with ways other than with metal, rather with the palms of our hand. Our City is founded on people and slow, individually allocated cohesion on a transitionary level. This will bring the return to the Center that the Lost Children of Isaac and the entire World needs. \n\tThis Grand Plan of the Almighty One of Creation has come to me out of Divine Word and heritage. It comes to All the World as Divine Word. This is because whether by Race (seed) or Grace (word), the entire World has been opened to the Right to be Kings and Queens of Man serving God Most High in this Place of Goodly Refuge. \n\tWe must do this now because both science and religion point to the end of days. Religion points to it from clues in the Old Testament. In each series of catastraphies in the old Testament, some things had to be done to preserve enough Humanity to survive the flood (air and fire). Proposed is a plan to begin construction of Shasta (what, in his lore, Tolkien called Minas Tirith at the end of the Third Age after the fall of Osgiliarth). That is the thing, we have taken a fall. \nNot only that but the Deutsche Archäologe Institut ** under Klaus Schmidt found (Turkish name) Göbekli Tepe. \n\nThat is the thing, we have taken a fall. So let us get up like a snake hissing through burrows on the ground is forced by a moral endeavor within his gut to wind itself up, for no reason whatsoever, a brass pole stood in the ground. Upon the climb, facing many doubts and desires in sensations and dreams, voices lure him back down to the ground, for he is only a snake. He belongs on the ground. He does not like heights, he feels sick. But he feels good somewhere, so he concentrates on that with even his toes and ears. Our snake has somehow made it only pushes away from the head of the staff. And before he expects it and has a chance to look around, the staff is heaved out of the spot it was in. The snake is on a forever journey on the rod. \n\tIn the presence of Divinity at this moment we must get ourselves onto our Living God’s rod. We may not have another chance. And the consequences of heaving ourselves up onto the pole would be a moral endeavor to harmonize life on Earth. \n\t\n\tHow to do it: \n\n\tStart small. We get started in the cities already established around the vast foot of Mount Shasta. We shall introduce ourselves there. I bring everyone who is interested to initiate into wor(l)d-space the Beautiful Sight of our Living Almighty God; that we, as mortal humans, establish a Moral Claim to fulfill ourside of the deal (specifically directed at Anglo-Saxon Americans) (meaning that we must harbor Faith and operate in concordance (divinity) instead of opposition (electricity). Going back to the stars, where light pollution, sound pollution, waste pollution are taken into account as blockading our return to those stars, we cut these pollutions out — by building with waste as like the Earth Ships in New Mexico. That is stage one. Earthships in the ground, were well water is plentiful even for fountains (of whose water we will sustain ourselves). \n\tTo be a beacon for the World and an Arc, every bit taken from the land must be used in that land alone. Here, at the foot of Sacred Mount Shasta, there are the Marble Mountains. Quartz veins run throughout the entire area (going to middle school quartz lies around in the gravel, in love). \n\t[Here I must interject and mention that if an attempt is begun to speed anything up to impatience under the idol of Progress, it will be blocked by the Hand of God and it would be like a spitting on his Gracious Hand. All development will be lead by local spiritual leaders. It is your job to be patient and discover the Light of the Lord in the Area.]  \n\t\n\tGetting more to the Light of the Beacon: \n\tThe University. It is actually a Mystery School. But it builds itself, in two ways. First, it builds itself from its first students onward. From then on out it becomes the community itself, all part of a flowering system of anatomy. As the physical buildings are constructed to reside in the land, Students of agriculture, who earnestly need practice for what they learned at UC Davis for instance, come to pioneer innovative and miraculous growing techniques to feel the blooming Humanity already living on the sea of glass emanating from the Mountain. \n\tThe region is beyond size comparison. Food can be grown in all cubic miles of the Northwest (up and down, left and right). The truth of it is, these mountains are our natural skyscrapers. Their folded slopes extend the length of the land beyond measure. And when we learn to grow food with the help of the trees that are there, we maximize natural space. We are on a moral endeavor to be at one (atone) with a Natural religion with our Living God. We want to live a compete return to our Creator, our Living God. He appears as we appear to Him. We approach the Origin of all religion, in One. Rasta brethren and sisters and roots reggae musicians are personally invited to walk through the streets as churches and beacons of light and joy. \n\tNatural religion, where we delve into feeling nature and appreciating it as non-fallen Nature, we shall embrace the entire Holy Tree that is Cannabis. It will indeed heal Generations. We shall plant forests of it, but one large Tree of Life shall we receive after working the land with our hands in alignment with Nature. It will grow collectively as we grow collectively; blessed by the divine presence of Living God, Eternal Weaver, who has intention about how he would like the piece to turn out, as we do when we weave. \n\tThe Human labor will be from the local citizens to begin with. Everything for them will be payed for by you. At first we look at which citizens have which skills. There are many skilled crafts people, millers, foresters, builders, landscape designers, all looking for work. You shall not employ them, you shall give them the money as their way to sustain their work that they love. \n\tIdeally we walk, as no other being on the planet is as good for walking as Human Beings; however, in the early stages, transportation must be established between cities around the mountain. Here we call upon students across the United States and the World to create all without patents. A Crystal City shall exist in all sharing of ideas and not boarders of currency but to continue self-sustainment (see China’s Hardware City). That city however is much unlike Shasta, for it has been built on the foundations of money. We shall build Shasta on the Foundations of our Living God, Ever Present. ",

He rested on it and wrapped his thin arms tightly around this shin.\nOn the ground before him was the fragments on a few dozen magazines he had cut and collected over the years. He shuffled them unconsciously. Before this moment he had had no plan for gluing them together. But now his desire had changed. Something called him to dump out his drawer and start to experiment with what fits with what.\nWith the fragments strewn and piled on the floor he found it difficult to start. What image is the foundation of the collage?\n\n\nWhat time in history have beings not formulated images from fragments?\nWhy then would our day and age be suffering from a remarkable fragmentation?\nA time when it is all known without the assembly process would be a time void of many challenges.\nThus, wouldn't our supposedly broken days be of a greater potential than the past millennia?\nI hypothesis that there have always been fragments out of which we strive to make whole worlds. Indeed before media, print, and architecture, humans have at least had other humans and these humans have been striving to thrive together since then. Before pictures and images and stained glass windows there have been the split images of God within humanity, no matter how primitive or advanced we were or will be.\nSo what's the commotion about today? Why are psychologists and art historians and authors prescribing, discussing and writing about the fragmentation of the soul and of the images of a shattered God?\nBecause it is difficult to know where to begin putting it together.\nFurthermore, putting it together for one person does not fit to the preferences of another.\n\nThe painters of the world take fragments of pigment and lay them atop and against each other to regenerate an image that we all see--an automobile, for instance. The painter chooses the most adequate method for doing this. Depending on skill and diligence the automobile fits better or worse to the public's collective eye. Of course there will always be a member of the public who is disgusted by the artist's rendition of an object that could easily be viewed in its perfect form by just looking out the window at the nearest parked car. But that is not exciting for the eye of the onlooker because it is only when something is remade with flaws and new characteristics do we really look at it for what it is--as an unified whole of fragments. The car traveling swiftly down the highway is a car. The blurred car in a painting is an amalgamation of only the superficial aspects of material and movement but somehow it touches a deeper appreciation in the viewer than the real subject itself.",

    "text" : "The racial consciousness or the Jungian collective unconsciousness\nStanisław Lem once wrote about the future of books.\nHe surmised that we, today, would be using handheld electronic blocks to read literature.\nHe was not the only creative mind to guess correctly about the condition of a technology obsessed world consciousness.\nThis however brings up the issue of dreams and where they come from.\nLem and many others have dreamt about their innovations. However are these innovations really \"theirs\"?\nAverage minds of a 21st Century scientific nature\n(friends and relatives for example–who are no doubt smarter than I)\noften justify their provable reality by claiming that dreams are only the left over of images,\nsounds, and other bits of experience experienced at an earlier date.\nThe concept of dreams motioning forward to what we haven't experienced is an idea worthy of no more investigation.\nThat's a fatal lie to the life giving core of a human being.\nA human being is as connected to a collected consciousness\nas all hot-spot islands are to the collective head of Earth's boiling metallic core.\nHow indeed would Lem dream of a hand-held technological device of the future\nif dreams are only based on what has yet before been sensed (seen, heard, etc.)?\n\nMy argument is that dreams should be considered an entitled individual\nand consequential sense just as vision and smell.\n\nA sense must not be equally well outfit in every individual as it is in a specific person with high achieving abilities.\nA woman with 15/15 vision has great natural abilities with her vision sense.\nNot all other woman need to equal her ability of vision in order to say that they also have the sense of vision.\nIt is the same with the sense of dream.\n\nMany scientists still wonder why we dream.\nSome say it's to digest the products of what we've passively experienced (yet not always acknowledged) before.\nBut do scientists still question why we see or hear?\nTo the best of my knowledge scientists have attributed our sense of sight to survival.\nSo to with smell, touch, taste, and hearing.\nYet of course we all know, to certain degrees, that these senses\nare a part of us not only for survival, they have special uses for us.\nCertain people require touch to fully love, others require more taste than a warm hand to enjoy the evening.\nThe spoils of a safe and technologically rich life\n(in various part of the world) have kicked our senses from survival\nto enjoyment of excess and luxury.\nThat not being inherently bad nor the topic of this text, I will go no further in explanation.\nThe Sense of Dream works on the body as does any other sense.\nAn individual may better dream than others and it means not that\nthe rest of us must dream as often or as vividly as she who does.\nIn addition, she with a strong sense of dream must not be also\nthe mastermind of dream analysis just as the woman with 15/15 vision\nmust not be an expert wild mushroom harvester.\nSome people are, however, born with the skills to comprehend their dreams and use them to influence their and others' lives in the waking world.\n\nWilliam Blake once wrote in 'Marriage of Heaven and Hell'\nthat \"Man has no body distinct from his Soul —\nfor what is called body is that portion of the soul discerned by the five senses....\"\nThus if we extend the Five to Six then we can finally see the method by which we as humans in individual bodies\ncan authentically feel as if we were inside another person's body.\nWhether waking or asleep our dream sense can unconsciously\nextend our consciousness through the racial consciousness\nto feel the consistency of another's situation.\nThis is an example of 'putting yourself into someone else's shoes'.\nHow many times have you asked someone if they could just please try to imagine what it's like for them?\n(\"You really can't see that mushroom under the moss right in front of you?\")\nLike with all senses we can learn to block our perception and fear the effect of clear acknowledgement.\nA man named Paul Levy, author of 'Dispelling Wetiko' wrote in this book about an experience\nin the waiting room of a hospital. He was in the hospital because his family and friends had labeled him 'gone mad'\nafter he had I fact broken through. He was sitting there waiting when he saw a woman\nwho was blind. She could not see. He approached her and spoke this phrase 3 time,\n\"All you have to do to see is open your eyes and look.\" And a miracle happened.\nAfter Levy's meeting with the doctor, the woman met him in the corridor.\nShe had begun to see.\nMuch of that story resonates with what I tell my teenage students in Germany\nwhile I taught English at a summer camp. I would give mini lectures about dreams.\nWe would discuss dreams and share our own experiences.\nIn one spectacular event I was talking about dream symbols, specifically death.\nMany students (adults as well) shudder at the image of death in dreams or on tarot cards or wherever.\nBut I had informed them that death in a dream worked symbolically and like the words we read on the page\nwe assign conscious meaning to them. Death to our dream sense organ means\nsomething completely different to our conscious thought organ.\nOften death in dreams means a transformation, a shedding of skin,\na release of energy for the space making of new, unknown energy.\nI said this to the group and asked what they though about what I had said so far.\nA young man who spoke fluent English rose his hand and said something\nthat I would have never in my life expected. He said, \"I had a dream that you told us this.\"\nA logically clever boy who wanted to take advantage of the authority of the teacher would have\nloved playing a trick like this, but his intention and focus on my eyes\n(not looking around the classroom for laughs or secret fraternity)\nreinforced my initial urge to trust him and his words.\n\nThis boy was an example of a highly tuned sense of dream, and like someone who has great vision, who we occasionally remark on.\nIt is detrimental to humanity to follow the corporate psychological methods at understanding the inperceivable sense of `to dream`.\n\nSenses cannot be influenced, but they can be listened to and ignored.\n\nParticularly important is to train oneself how to identify fears and clues,\nbecause we are now in the dream zone and we are being approached by much of what we don't and cannot understand.",

You can’t touch it. So what’s the point in telling you?”\n“I’m curious, I guess, on what you’ll live on. What good will imaginary foods do on your stomach?”\n“The same way real food does nothing to the non-tangible spirit. Nothing. The well-fed emperor isn’t always a saint.”\n“I can’t entertain anything like this.

That part that has been surviving there without food or warmth since you became successful?”\n“I became more mature with my success than I’d ever been.”\n“You can’t hear me because of that very concept of success. It means nothing to your invisible hands. They care so little about your possessions that they break them to try to get your attention. Your invisible ears don’t enjoy the noise of news coming from your new system. Your invisible eyes can’t enjoy the cleansed kitchen, for there is no life in all your order.

I’m taking my invisible broom and invisible dustpan and, see!, I’m sweeping up my dishes.”\n“You just made more of a mess actually.”\n“You’re fucking crazy! Just put your dishes away, you lazy piece of shit!”\n“I can’t.”\n“Yes. You can.

I have to put my dishes away. —“\n“So do it!”\n“—But you have a more difficult task—“\n“I have enough things to do.”\n“—To leave and enter the house for a week while my dishes are there without feeling the slightest bit of annoyance.”",

You are not your president.\n        You are not the government that claims control nor are you the lurking red/blue shades of regime.\n        By the almighty forces of adventure, finally see yourself as the continuation of a revolution for mankind.\n        Do not find the reasons to hate others because of their bad choice.\n        Practice freedom in the purest form by making your own choices and letting others make theirs,\n        until, that is, it comes down to the loss of languages and rituals.\n        Do not sit on your own abilities in favor of tempting a kind hand to comfort you.\n        Comfort yourself, you dynamo of broad capacity.\n        Shake down the streets to the vibrational power of a collective mantra.\n        Settle the score among ailing peoples that have gone so long dodging the heavy rain of your righteous temperament.\n        \n\tMy musings aren’t of judgement.\n    They are only a channel of information that can be looked upon like a terrible reflection in a bird’s bath:\n    It is that a political situation cannot control me.\n    The system in mundaneness has been broken.\n    From the strengthening of the dark side comes the enlighten wand of the light side.\n    The trust in the instant fall will save us from the ultimate shattering.\n    We are as our dream characters, able to control the least controllable.\n    Before you find out, we know.\n    Trust the give and take of the universal energy – this push and pull.\n    It’s no coincidence that our doors plead us to do it that way:\n    Push and pull – push and pull.\n\tIn some way we are able to learn even more from the unintentional nature of our lifeless material than we even realize.\n    What else can we do but try to respect the inanimate clues to this inanimate world?\n\tSo as we look upon the outside, let us first understand the inside,\n    yet understand also the flame that burns as we burn with it, this everlasting fire;\n    from the numbness of our limbs when they fall asleep\n    to the exoteric pleasures of a million wingspans,\n    this is our world – and before anyone else takes it from us collectively,\n    we’ll bleed poetry into the street.",
